# Filesystem

This is a user space portable index-allocated file system implementation. It provides users with a virtual disk image and supports various file system operations such as creating the file system, listing files, adding files, removing files, and saving the file system. The file system uses an index allocation scheme and supports files up to 2^20 bytes in size. It has a single-level directory structure and allows up to 256 files. The implementation is written in C/C++ and includes a command-line interface for interacting with the file system.
